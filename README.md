# Listy
Ever had the idea to do a program and got confused and didnt knew where to start?
fear no more my dear friend, Listy is here for you!

Listy is a open-source project, made to help people organize their actions, Listy creates lists in a easy way
without the need of you numerating each item and creating titles, subtitles and comments automaticaly.

I had the idea to work on this project cause im very disorganized, and since i like programming, i always had to write this huge
algorithms with all the steps and program functions, wich was a pain in the butt, so i thought, what if i could automate this?
and thats what i did!

Listy is very simple to use, select the type of list item you want(regular item, title, subtitle or comment) and type what you
want, done!

each type of item has its own output on the final list output:

Regular item : this is just a regular list item wich contains a number to its left.

  example :
    1- regular item;
    2- example;
    3- number three;
    
Title : the title is a all caps list item used when you want to make groups of items and it also resets the item number to 1.

  example :
    ===TITLE===
    1- regular item;

Subtitle : the subtitle is a all cpas list item used when you want to make subgroups of items but it doesnt reset the item number
to 1.

  example:
    ---SUBTITLE---
    4- regular item;

Comment : the comment can be used when you want to describe a list item with more detail.

  example:
    1- comment;
    (THIS IS A COMMENT)
